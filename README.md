# Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System

These are set of files for developing IoT based firmware for ESP32 using IDF(IoT Development Framework) provided by espressif. The files were rusty, definitely need to look :()
Most of the files are self explanatory and feasibly understandable by mid level experienced embedded C programmer. Contents from basic GPIO testing to WIFI and Bluetooth Mesh were available. 
In brief, list of major concept's widely used in IoT communication and security with respect to files were:<br />
- Advanced Encryption Standard<br />
- Bluetooth Connection (Simple Serial Data Protocol Transfer)<br />
- MESH<br />
- Firmare Over The Air (OTA)<br />
- Pulse Width Modulation of in-built LED<br />
- UART Event functionality<br />
- Simple Network Time Protocol<br />
- Non Volatile Storage<br />
- MQTT <br />
- JSON<br />
- Firebase Sample<br />
- BT and WIFI Scan<br />

For detailed understanding of ESP32 and it's siblings please have a look at offiial source "http://esp32.net/" and from river to ocean here "https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/"
Enjoy the embedded system knowledge.




------  Note: The files were already in lazy state and waiting for some coding guidelines. Soon will be done  ------
